# Clock Algorithmns

*  more efficient version of FIFO and second-chance bc pages dont have to be constantly pushed to the back of the list but performs the same general function as Second-Chance

# Thrasing
### just know the term and that's all

* **thrash** is the poor performance of a virtual memory (or paging) system when the same pages are being loaded repeatedly due to a lack of main memory to keep them in memory. Depending on the configuration and algorithm, the actual throughput of a system can degrade by multiple orders of magnitude.

* high rate of page eviction and page fetching going on that severely affect sperformance to a halt

# Beladi's Anomaly
* more ram slower why 

# Context Switch
*  involves saving the context or state of a running process so that it can be restored later, and then loading the context or state of another. process and run it.

* Context Switching refers to the process/method used by the system to change the process from one state to another using the CPUs present in the system to perform its job
